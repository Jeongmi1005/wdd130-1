        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is to introduce the audience to what product we are selling. The goals are to make the customers be able to window shop the product they like and be able to order them easily. I want this website can be able to review the product easily and each product can be able to connect to a bigger view website with more explanations about that product. Also, I would love to make the website can be able to add products to like, so the customers can be able to review what kinds of products they like and give comments that they have toward the products.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        On page 2, there will be pictures where customers can see more products. It will also be a page of photos and more descriptions of the product so that customers can easily review the product. The product description may include the size, material, and color of the clothes.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 will create a page like Q&A. It will be a page that customers can deliver to the company when they have inquiries or opinions about the product. This page may also give feedback on what customers were satisfied or dissatisfied with.
