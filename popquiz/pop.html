    <p>2 Nephi 19 -20 In these verses, Nephi addresses their beloved brethren and emphasizes that their journey is not yet complete. They have reached a difficult path, symbolized by the strait and narrow path, but their progress thus far has been possible through their unwavering faith in Christ and reliance on His saving power. He encourages them to continue pressing forward in their faith in Christ, remaining steadfast. We should hold onto a perfect brightness of hope and have love for God and all people. By diligently studying and feasting upon the word of Christ and persevering until the end, we are promised eternal life by the Father.</p>
