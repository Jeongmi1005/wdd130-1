        <li>2. Artisan carving wax plate: Jewelry craftsmen of jewelry hand-carved the wax plate with reference to the design drawings and then poured out the silver plate using the method of lost wax casting.</li>
        <li>3. Plastic injection wax: After the rubber mold is opened, the wax injection operation is performed. The wax in the wax injection machine should be kept between 70-75 degrees, the wax liquid is injected into the film, and the wax mold is taken out after cooling.</li> 
        <li> 4. Choose the matching stone: Choose matching stones of suitable size, shape, and color according to the silver plate and wax mold.</li>
        <li>5. Complete the wax-up: Have all the stencils ready for this batch.</li>
        <li>6. Plant wax trees: Each wax ring is individually hand welded to a wax stick, resulting in a wax tree shaped like a large tree, ready for casting.</li>
        <li> 7. Weighing the wax tree: Weigh the rubber base before planting the wax tree</li>
